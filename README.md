# Computer Methods For Science

This course can work in a local installation of Jupyter, Git, Julia, LaTeX and the like. 
But in order to do the starting of the course painless to who has not a local installation of all the requeriments, 
it can be loaded into a JuliaBox instance, see https://juliabox.org.

## Load this tutorial

Go to JuliaBox and log-in there. You can use a Twitter, Linked-in, or if you prefeer a Google account to log into JuliaBox.
Despite the name of JuliaBox, it comes with a very complete suite for scientific development.
On the other hand for its simplicity, it is ideal for the learning pourpose of this course.

Once you are logged into JuliaBox, download this tutorial. For that go to console and simply type the following command to download the necessary files from GitLab

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/i-apellaniz/ComputerMethodsForScience.git
```

or you can download it from GitHub if you prefeer in a similar way 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/i-apellaniz/ComputerMethodsForScience.git
```

A new folder will be created with the all the material.
So, go to that folder and open the file called `00-IntroductionToThisCourse.ipynb`.
Have fun!!
